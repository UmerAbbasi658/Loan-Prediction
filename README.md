# Loan-Prediction
Dataset OverviewThe file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. 
The data include customer demographicinformation (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securitiesaccount, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered tothem in the earlier campaign.
Dataset ContextThis case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways ofconverting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them asdepositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthyconversion rate of over 9% success.
This has encouraged the retail marketing department todevise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget
